= Eventuate Tram (Transactional Messaging) framework

The Eventuate Tram framework enables a Java/Spring application to send messages as part of an database transaction.
This enables an application atomically update state and send a message or a domain event.
It is a foundation of ensuring data consistency within a http://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html[microservice architecture].

Eventuate Tram (which was formerly known as Tarr) is described in more detail in my book https://www.manning.com/books/microservice-patterns[Microservice Patterns] and the http://eventuate.io/tram/gettingstarted.html[getting started guide].
It provides several messaging abstractions:

* messaging - send and receive messages over named channels
* events - publish domain events and subscribe to domain events
* commands - asynchronously send a command to a service and receive a reply

== How it works

Eventuate Tram messaging implements the http://microservices.io/patterns/data/application-events.html[Application events pattern].
An message producer inserts events into an `OUTBOX` table as part of the ACID transaction that updates data, such as JPA entities.
A separate message relay (a.k.a. CDC service) publishes messages to the message broker.

The message relay works in one of two ways:

* http://microservices.io/patterns/data/transaction-log-tailing.html[Transaction log tailing] - currently implemented for MySQL
* Polling - for other databases

== Getting started

Please see the http://eventuate.io/tram/gettingstarted.html[getting started guide].

== Example applications

== Transactional messaging

Send a message using `MessageProducer`:

```java
public interface MessageProducer {
  void send(String destination, Message message);
}
```

Receive messages using:

```java
public interface MessageConsumer {
  void subscribe(String subscriberId, Set<String> channels, MessageHandler handler);
}
```

See this example of https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-core-examples-basic/blob/master/eventuate-tram-examples-common/src/main/java/io/eventuate/tram/examples/basic/messages/AbstractTramMessageTest.java[transactional messaging].

=== Transactional domain events

The domain event package builds on the core APIs.

Publish domain events using the `DomainEventPublisher` interface:

```java
public interface DomainEventPublisher {

  void publish(String aggregateType, Object aggregateId, List<DomainEvent> domainEvents);
  ...
```

Subscribe to domain events using a `DomainEventDispatcher`:

```java
public class DomainEventDispatcher {
    public DomainEventDispatcher(String eventDispatcherId,
                DomainEventHandlers eventHandlers,
                ...) {
...
}
```

Handle the events using `DomainEventHandlers`:

```java
public class RestaurantOrderEventConsumer {

  public DomainEventHandlers domainEventHandlers() {
    return DomainEventHandlersBuilder
            .forAggregateType("net.chrisrichardson.ftgo.restaurantservice.Restaurant")
            .onEvent(RestaurantMenuRevised.class, this::reviseMenu)
            .build();
  }

  public void reviseMenu(DomainEventEnvelope<RestaurantMenuRevised> de) {
```

See this example of https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-core-examples-basic/blob/master/eventuate-tram-examples-common/src/main/java/io/eventuate/tram/examples/basic/events/AbstractTramEventTest.java[transaction events].

== Transactional commands

Transaction commands are implemented using transactional messaging.

Send a command using a `CommandProducer`:

```java
public interface CommandProducer {
  String send(String channel, Command command, String replyTo, Map<String, String> headers);
  ...
}
```

Subscribe to commands using a `CommandDispatcher`:

```java
public class CommandDispatcher {

  public CommandDispatcher(String commandDispatcherId,
           CommandHandlers commandHandlers) {
  ...
}
```

Handle commands and send a reply using `CommandHandlers`:

```java
public class OrderCommandHandlers {


  public CommandHandlers commandHandlers() {
    return CommandHandlersBuilder
          .fromChannel("orderService")
          .onMessage(ApproveOrderCommand.class, this::approveOrder)
          ...
          .build();
  }

  public Message approveOrder(CommandMessage<ApproveOrderCommand> cm) {
    ApproveOrderCommand command = cm.getCommand();
    ...
  }

```

== Maven/Gradle artifacts

The artifacts are in https://bintray.com/eventuateio-oss/eventuate-maven-release/eventuate-tram[JCenter].
The latest version is:

There are the following API artifacts:

* `io.eventuate.tram.core:eventuate-tram-messaging:$eventuateTramVersion` - core messaging APIs
* `io.eventuate.tram.core:eventuate-tram-events:$eventuateTramVersion` - domain event API
* `io.eventuate.tram.core:eventuate-tram-commands:$eventuateTramVersion` - commands/reply API

There are the following 'implementation' artifacts:

* `io.eventuate.tram.core:eventuate-tram-jdbc-kafka:$eventuateTramVersion` - JDBC database and Apache Kafka message broker
* `io.eventuate.tram.core:eventuate-tram-in-memory:$eventuateTramVersion` - In-memory JDBC database and in-memory messaging for testing

== Running the CDC service

In addition to a database and message broker, you will need to run the Eventuate Tram CDC service.
It reads events inserted into the database and publishes them to Apache Kafka.
It is written using Spring Boot.
The easiest way to run this service during development is to use Docker Compose.
The https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-core-examples-basic[Eventuate Tram Code Basic examples] project has an example https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-core-examples-basic/blob/master/docker-compose.yml[docker-compose.yml file].
